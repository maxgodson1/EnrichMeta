\title{Calculate shared metabolites between pathways}
\usage{
shared_compounds(pathway_data, min_shared = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathway_data}{Data structure containing pathway information.
Should be the output from `getkd()` or a similar function.}

\item{min_shared}{Minimum number of shared metabolites required to
create an edge between pathways (default: 1).}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
  \item{graph}{An igraph network object representing pathways as nodes
               and shared metabolites as edges}
  \item{shared_df}{A data.frame containing detailed information about
                  shared metabolites between pathway pairs}
  \item{pathway_names}{A named vector mapping pathway IDs to pathway names}
  \item{compound_counts}{A vector containing metabolite counts for each pathway}
}
\description{
This function analyzes the shared metabolites between different pathways
and creates a network representation of the relationships.

# After performing enrichment analysis

  pathways = kegg_data$pathways[selected_pathways],
  pathway2compound = kegg_data$pathway2compound[selected_pathways]

# Plot the network
