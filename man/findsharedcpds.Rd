\title{Calculate Shared Metabolites Between Selected Pathways}
\usage{
findsharedcpds(pathwayid, pathway_data, min_shared = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathwayid}{Character vector of pathway IDs to analyze (e.g., "hsa00010")}

\item{pathway_data}{Pathway data object from \code{\link{getkeggdata}} containing:
\itemize{
  \item `path_cpd_map`: List of compounds per pathway
}}

\item{min_shared}{Minimum shared metabolites for inclusion (default = 1)}
}
\value{
A data frame detailing shared metabolites between pathway pairs with columns:
  \itemize{
    \item from: Source pathway ID
    \item to: Target pathway ID
    \item shared_count: Number of shared metabolites
    \item keggID: Semicolon-separated list of shared metabolite IDs
  }
}
\description{
Analyzes metabolite sharing between user-specified pathways and returns a data frame of shared metabolites.
}
\details{
Computes pairwise metabolite sharing between user-selected pathways. Only pathway pairs with at least
`min_shared` metabolites are included. Pathways are compared based on their metabolite composition.

# After enrichment analysis
