\title{Calculate Shared Metabolites Between Pathways}
\usage{
shared_compounds(pathway_data, min_shared = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathway_data}{Pathway data from `getkd()` containing:
\itemize{
  \item `pathways`: Named vector of pathway names
  \item `pathway2compound`: List of compounds per pathway
}}

\item{min_shared}{Minimum shared metabolites for edge creation (default = 1)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \item{graph}{igraph network object (pathways = nodes, shared metabolites = edges)}
  \item{shared_df}{Data frame detailing shared metabolites between pathway pairs}
  \item{pathway_names}{Named vector mapping pathway IDs to names}
  \item{compound_counts}{Vector of metabolite counts per pathway}
}
\description{
Analyzes metabolite sharing between pathways and creates network representations.
}
\details{
Computes pairwise metabolite sharing between pathways and constructs:
\itemize{
  \item Network where edge weight = number of shared metabolites
  \item Data frame with detailed compound sharing information
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After enrichment analysis
filtered_data <- list(
  pathways = kegg_data$pathways[selected_pathways],
  pathway2compound = kegg_data$pathway2compound[selected_pathways]
)
shared_result <- shared_compounds(filtered_data, min_shared = 2)

# Plot network
plot(shared_result$graph)
}
